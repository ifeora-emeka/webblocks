### Explain the project

I'm creating a website builder with and chakra ui where I have an array of elements and each element has an index and reference to it's parent element using element ID and parent element ID. Then using a compiler function, I convert the array of element objects into a nested object such that a parent element object has it's children attached to it with their index starting at 0 and a reference to their parent (parent ID).




This is just for context, don't do anything yet.
